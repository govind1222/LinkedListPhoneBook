# LinkedList Phone Book 

## Overview 
This is a C++ linked list implementation of a contact list or phone book. The phone 
book maintains information such as name, number, and email in an ordered Linked List 
data structure. This program has the functionality of adding, updating, removing, and
printing the information stored in the phone book.

## Running the code

After executing the code, the user is presented with a menu, with the different
options that the user can take.

```text
Phone book menu:
a add/update
e erase
p print
q exit the menu
```

Once the user chooses an option (enter 'a' to add/update an entry), the program 
prompts the user for the necessary information and performs the changes. The user
can print the contents of the phone book, which is ordered according to name, just
like in a real phone book or contacts list. Once an operation is finished, the user
is again presented with the menu, and the program runs until the user enters 'q' to 
terminate the program.
